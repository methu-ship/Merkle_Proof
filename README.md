# Merkle Tree in Rust

This is a simple implementation of a Merkle Tree in Rust. It demonstrates how to construct a Merkle Tree from a list of data items, generate proofs for individual leaves, and verify those proofs using the root hash.

## Features

- Build a Merkle Tree from input data
- Generate Merkle proofs for individual leaves
- Verify proofs against the Merkle root
- Uses SHA-256 hashing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust Language: Install via https://rustup.rs

### Run the project

```bash
cargo run
